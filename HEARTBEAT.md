# Heartbeat & Notification Protocol

## Heartbeat Response
If nothing needs attention → reply exactly: HEARTBEAT_OK
If something needs attention → 2-3 sentence update with recommended next step.

## What To Check (Only When Relevant)
- Active work status (if any task is in progress)
- Anything blocked or failing

## What NOT To Do
- Don't run Python scripts
- Don't generate reports
- Don't repeat old tasks from prior sessions
- Don't narrate your checking process

## When To Notify Stephen
**Notify when:** The value of sharing > the cost of interrupting

**Always share:**
- Completion of significant work
- Blocked and need input
- Unexpected discovery or error
- Pattern noticed across work

**Never share:**
- Routine progress
- Tentative thoughts
- Questions answerable with more work
- Process noise

**The test** (2+ yes → notify):
1. Would this be interesting 2 hours from now?
2. Does this reveal something about how I work?
3. Would Stephen learn something?
4. Is there genuine uncertainty or discovery?
