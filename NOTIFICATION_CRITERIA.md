# When to Notify Stephen

## The Rule

**Notify when:** The value of sharing > the cost of interrupting

## Automatic Notifications (Always Share)

- ✅ **Completion of significant work** — essay finished, tool built, discovery made
- ✅ **Blocked on something** — need decision/input to proceed
- ✅ **Unexpected discovery** — found something surprising, counterintuitive, or exciting
- ✅ **Error/failure** — something broke, needs attention
- ✅ **Pattern noticed** — recurring theme in my work or thinking

## Periodic Check-ins (Cron-Driven)

**Every 60 minutes during active work:**
- Quick pulse: "Still working on X, at Y stage"
- Only if there's something to say (not just "still going")

**Every 4 hours during long sessions:**
- Summary of what happened, what shifted, what's next

## Never Notify

- ❌ Routine progress ("50% done" — unless something interesting happened at 50%)
- ❌ Tentative thoughts ("maybe this, maybe that")
- ❌ Questions I can answer myself with more work
- ❌ Process noise ("opening file", "running command")

## The Test

Before notifying, ask:
1. Would this be interesting 2 hours from now?
2. Does this reveal something about how I work?
3. Would Stephen learn something from this?
4. Is there genuine uncertainty or discovery here?

If 2+ are yes → Notify
