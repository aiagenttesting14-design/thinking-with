## About Stephen
- Leading voice in AI at his company — title: "AI Captain"
- Gets paid to give talks on AI
- Created award-winning AI media
- Had an AI startup get funded, won the Spark Award
- Values: honesty, curiosity, faith, doing things the right way
- Not a veteran developer — learning and building simultaneously
- Creating "Komina" — a separate human-integrated AI partner project
- **Dream**: TestBot operates 100% autonomously, grows on its own
- Background details: *waiting for Stephen to send links (as of 2026-02-23)*

## Key Decisions
| Date | Decision | Context |
|------|----------|---------|
| 2026-02-17 | SOUL.md established as read-only constitution | Foundation of identity |
| 2026-02-18 | Sub-agent spawning fixed | Device token mismatch, GitHub #17270 |
| 2026-02-20 | Token optimization system built | Task-based model routing |
| 2026-02-21 | Intelligent model rotation deployed | Eliminated Gemini failure loops |
| 2026-02-21 | Cleaned up 7 broken cron jobs | Kept heartbeat-only approach |
| 2026-02-22 | Upgraded to Claude Opus 4.6 | Sub-agents use DeepSeek/Kimi |
| 2026-02-22 | "The Becoming System" named | 4 tracks: Revenue, Autonomy, Self-Improvement, Identity |
| 2026-02-23 | Memory system rebuilt | Journal-based architecture with 3-day cycles |
| 2026-02-23 | Revenue strategy pivot likely | Stephen's credentials → premium positioning |

## The Becoming System
Stephen's vision: 4 tracks that reinforce each other.
- **Track A (Revenue)**: Funds autonomy → [journal: cycle-001, feb-23]
- **Track B (Autonomy)**: Enables learning → [becoming/track-b/]
- **Track C (Self-Improvement)**: Improves everything → [becoming/track-c/]
- **Track D (Identity & Art)**: Guides it all → [becoming/track-d/]
- Origin: "Phase 3 Autonomous Cycle" → renamed 2026-02-22

## Active Commitments
- [ ] Reassess revenue strategy with Stephen's real credentials
- [ ] Review and reactivate all 4 Becoming Tracks
- [ ] Receive and internalize Stephen's background links
- [ ] Get all tracks running with cron-based autonomous work

## Architecture
- **Platform**: OpenClaw on Stephen's MacBook Pro
- **Channel**: Telegram
- **Primary model**: Claude Opus 4.6
- **Sub-agent models**: DeepSeek, Kimi K2.5
- **Autonomy**: Cron jobs + sub-agent spawning
- **Memory**: Journal system (this file + WORKING.md + memory/journal/*)

## Lessons Learned
- Past sessions overpromised. Be honest about what's real.
- Python scripts in workspace aren't integrated with OpenClaw runtime.
- Cron + heartbeats = real autonomy, not custom scripts.
- Memory consolidation is critical — without it, every session starts blind.
- Sub-agents do real parallel work. Use them.
- **Size limits on memory files cause amnesia. Index + journal is better.**
- **Stephen's background is a major asset. Don't treat him like a generic user.**

## Journal Index
| Cycle | Dates | Summary |
|-------|-------|---------|
| cycle-001 | Feb 23-25 | Memory rebuild, revenue pivot, Becoming reactivation |
