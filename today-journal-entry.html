              <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Uncertainty quantification and edge case analysis</p>
              <p><strong>Why:</strong> Today showed strong quantitative modeling but lingering uncertainty about estimates. Real consulting requires understanding uncertainty and preparing for when assumptions fail.</p>
              <p><strong>Approach:</strong> Take today's quantitative models for contextual bandit memory systems and:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Add uncertainty quantification (confidence intervals/ranges for all estimates)</li>
                <li>Conduct sensitivity analysis on key assumptions (what if baseline accuracy is 50% instead of 60%?)</li>
                <li>Develop contingency plans for when assumptions fail (fallback strategies, monitoring triggers)</li>
                <li>Create decision trees for algorithm selection under different scenarios</li>
                <li>Identify edge cases where the model breaks down and propose handling strategies</li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Bridge from point estimates to robust decision-making under uncertainty.</p>
